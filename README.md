# Tristan Gousse - Web & Mobile Developer | Security Researcher

Salut! 👋 I'm Tristan Gousse, a passionate web and mobile developer hailing from the picturesque landscapes of France. At 34, I've dedicated my professional journey to crafting seamless digital experiences. Beyond coding, I delve into the captivating realms of security research and bug hunting.

## 🌐 Web & Mobile Development

As a seasoned developer, my hands have danced on the keyboard to create web and mobile applications that not only meet but exceed expectations. I believe in the power of clean code, elegant design, and user-centric development.

## 🔒 Security Research & Bug Hunter

In the shadows of the digital world, I transform into a vigilant guardian. My enthusiasm for ethical hacking is more than just a hobby; it's a commitment to ensuring the resilience of digital ecosystems. I hunt for bugs, unravel vulnerabilities, and contribute to the community's collective effort to fortify our online landscapes.

## 🤝 Contributions & Projects

While I may be a passive observer in the ethical hacking community, my contributions resonate with quality over quantity. I believe in enhancing existing projects and only venturing into new ones when there's a gap to fill. Collaborating on open-source projects is not just about code; it's about crafting solutions that stand the test of cyber scrutiny.

## 🚀 Current Focus

At 34, I find myself drawn to the ever-evolving challenges in the tech space. My current focus includes not only refining my development skills but also actively participating in ethical hacking discussions and initiatives.
